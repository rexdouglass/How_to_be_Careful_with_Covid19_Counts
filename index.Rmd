#The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

#Notes to self
#It's not like R notebook you have the knit every time you want to update html, you can't just save
#You don't have to rerun the code or rebuild the whole book though.

# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
